								SHINCHAN AND MATHEMATICAL TABLES	


Shinchan is the leader of "Kasukabe Defence Force" but now his leadership is being challenged by none other than his very own friend Kazama.
There is now chaos among the force, so Shinchan's teacher decides to intervene and come to a mutual understanding.
She hands them both one integer and asks them to return the mathematical table till 10 of that number.
Now Shinchan may be a great leader and everything, but he hates mathematics, so he turns to you, his friend for help.
Would you help Shinchan retain his leadership?
