							SHINCHAN AND FREQUENCIES

Now since you helped Shinchan defeat the King, the throne is now yours.
But as we all know good things dont last long and the bad ones never leave. 
So the King had one passcode set up to the ones who can access the source to unlimited treasure. ;_;.
Now, as we all are in dire need of money, we turn to you. Our Saviour.

The question here is, we are provided a string (S) and one character (X). All we have to do is go through the entire string and print the frequency of X in S.

INPUT FORMAT:

First line will contain an integer T
The next 3*T lines follow as such:
1st Line contains length of string (S)
2nd Line contains a string (S)
3rd Line contains a character (X).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Print one single integer, the frequency of X in S.
